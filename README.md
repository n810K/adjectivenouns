# adjectivenouns

## Purpose

I was having fun creating long alliterative descriptions. This will quickly generate an adjective-noun link to a certain length as given by the user. The user can then determine whether to use a random noun, or a given one.

## Features
- Varying adjective chain lengths
- Choice between random noun or user provided noun

### Notes
- If you want to use your own noun/adjective list, include adjective.txt and noun.txt in a folder called "wordlists"
